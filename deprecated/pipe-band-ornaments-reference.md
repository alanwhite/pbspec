## Notes on Implementation

### Context Sensitivity
- Same ornament notation produces different grace note patterns depending on the target note
- Regional variations exist (Scottish vs. Irish vs. competitive vs. traditional styles)
- Skill level adaptations required (simplified versions for beginners)

### Technical Requirements
- Each ornament has specific rhythmic requirements
- SMuFL mapping may require multiple Unicode codepoints
- Audio correlation needed for practice feedback systems
- Timing precision essential for proper musical effect, including ability to specify individual timings of grace notes
